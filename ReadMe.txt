Test submission for back-end coding evaluation
----------------------------------------------

Hi!

This solution was written in Kotlin using IntelliJ.
The solution uses Junit 5.
Test files are included to support the test suite.
I ran out of time before packaging up, so execution of the tool and tests is
currently via the IDE.
Test configurations are included.

I probably used a little under 2 hours total for this test - unfortunately I had
to deal with a family emergency in the middle so my time-keeping was probably
not as exact as it should have been.

I look forward to discussing the solution with you!

Best,
Melissa Green
